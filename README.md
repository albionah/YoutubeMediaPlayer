# Youtube Media Player
It is an extension for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), which adds ability to control Youtube videos.

## Requirements
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
- [Youtube Controller](https://github.com/albionah/YoutubeController)
- [Youtube Api Exposer](https://github.com/albionah/YoutubeApiExposer)

## Full support
You can use built-in or other custom media player components but features are very limited. I recommned to use my custom Lovelace component created specialy for controlling Youtube. You can find it [here](https://github.com/albionah/YoutubeCard).
### Features supported only by my component
- search bar
- hints
- video browsing
